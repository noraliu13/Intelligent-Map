## 📊 Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Solution

The system incorporates advanced optimization techniques to solve routing problems, including the **Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**.

### Approach
- **Greedy Algorithm** – baseline solution for constructing an initial path  
- **Multi-Greedy** – multiple greedy strategies to enhance starting solutions  
- **2-Opt Local Search** – iterative edge swaps to reduce total route cost  
- **Simulated Annealing** – probabilistic optimization to escape local minima  
- **Multithreading** – parallel execution of computations for efficiency  

This hybrid approach allows the system to generate **fast and near-optimal routes** within strict time constraints.
